## Henry's Notes:
1. Potential Measurement Error on Number of Children
There is no variable called "number of children", we can only see the number of children who LIVE TOGETHER. And that is the reason why we see the camel shape of the age distribution of who do not have kid: people tend to have kids live with them around their 30 to 45, and when kids become adults they have their own living place.
Hence, the measure we have is actually "number of children live together", a proximate for the "number of children".
